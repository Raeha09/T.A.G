    <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>Welcome to The Anonymous Gambler. Inspired by a Gambler aiming to recover and aspiring to motivate others. </p>

        <p>The Anonymous Gambler or (TAG) for short. Has been set up and inspired by a Gamblers own life experiences and journey to trying to recover from a gambling addiction. It's been a rocky road and a very tiresome trek but... The Gambler is still here and with plenty of memoirs and tales to tell about their journey along the way to recovery.  </p>

        <p>The main aim was to create a platform which could be used to talk to fellow or recovering Gamblers about their life experiences. And give those that are willing to share a platform to give feedback on the impact those experiences have had on their life...good or bad!.  </p>
